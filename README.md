Get started with different mathematical topics heavily used in computer science and graphic programming. Understand how they work and develop an intuition to know when to use them.

Our content is [viewable on our blog](https://learn-computer-graphics.com/mathematics/) with the help of Jupyter Book. You can also use the book as [standalone](https://mathematics.learn-computer-graphics.com/) for better performance on mobile.

## How to build

Need to install python. Then move inside the repository folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Finally, build the book by running `jupyter-book build .`
