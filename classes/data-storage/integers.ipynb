    "Integers are the **bread and butter of every computer program**. In fact, for a long time, there was no floating points in computers and they were the only available number representation (*check floating point notebook for more detail*). One big advantage is that they are **reliable, easy to store and to understand** as we will see together. Some languages even gives access to their binary representation to allow some advanced operation by the programmer.\n",

If you put 8 bits together it is called a <b>byte</b>.
